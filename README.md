# FLUXNET_Wet_sfc_evap
FLUXNET data from 171 stations and software to process it for use in the complementary relationship of evaporation. This repo is intended to allow users to reproduce the analyses from manuscript under review in the journal HESS (Hydrology and Earth System Science). The software and the csv files for 171 stations are included. All data files were obtained from the fluxnet.org web site. Files are all csv. Fluxnet files contain the daily (filename contains "DD") and monthly (filename contains, "MM") average flux data. Sensible and latent heat fluxes are from eddy covariance measurements.

The goal of the project is to gain insight into the meaning of the Priestley-Taylor wet-surface evaporation parameter alpha. Four hypotheses regarding how to estimate alpha are proposed in the manuscript.

The manuscript (still under review) describing the study in detail is at

I will update the link if the paper gets accepted.
